# Reference

Negative Sampling in Semi-Supervised Learning (NS3L) was proposed in the ICML 2020 paper "Negative Sampling in Semi-Supervised Learning". We recommend reading the paper for the motivation and empirical results of this method. NS3L is designed to boost the performance of existing SSL algorithms simply by adding the loss and is fairly robust to a reasonably large range of hyperparameters.
